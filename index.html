		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>We are a group of students studying MSc Aerospace Engineering at the University of Manchester, working on creating an aircraft out of foamboards and everyday common items. We come from all around the world, with diverse experiences and ideas.</p>
		<p>Just like any group project, when we first started planning this aircraft, we had ambitious ideas on how to design this aircraft and the direction that we wanted to head. From the beginning, we wanted our designs to be modular. But as time went on, we started understanding the constraints and materials we had to work with. We realized that we were making parts and destroying them too quickly. With more iterative testing, we understood that the way we were approaching this design thinking was flawed.</p>
		<p>The next semester, we incorporated a fresh perspective. We had a vision in mind. We created our aircraft to be Simple, Smart, and Sustainable. We reviewed all our basics and restarted everything from scratch. </p>
		<p>An Airplane that Anyone Can Build. </p>
		<p>An Airplane that could be broken up into smaller workable pieces.</p>
		<p>And an Airplane that produces less waste, and lasts.</p>
		<p>Introducing, the Flykea.</p>
